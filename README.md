## rsunderr's README

- Hi, I'm name is Ryan Sundermeyer
- I am a senior at SDSU majoring in Computer Engineering
- I am the president of the SDSU Mechatronics club
- My favorite things to work with are embedded systems, sensors, and the command line, and I enjoy both high-level and low-level coding
- My main languages are python, C/C++, and bash, but I also dabble in html/css, js, java, verilog, assembly, and lua
- I am always happy to collaborate with other people who share my interests, and working on bigger projects is one of my favorite things about coding
